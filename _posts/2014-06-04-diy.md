The whole blog is static using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) platform. You can check raw content here [https://github.com/rodion-zheludkov/blog](https://github.com/rodion-zheludkov/blog).

[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) formatting is used in raw source.

Formulas are done with [Mathjax](http://www.mathjax.org/).
